        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is xueli(Zoe), and I am currently a senior at Brigham Young University-Idaho, majoring in Computer Science with a GPA of 4. I’m excited to be here and to share my experiences.

            Throughout my academic career, I have developed a strong foundation in data science and software engineering. My coursework, combined with my internship experiences, has equipped me with the skills to work with complex datasets and create efficient, scalable systems.
            I also
            enjoy a variety of hobbies that keep me engaged with technology, such as swimming, skiing,
            traveling, reading, playing video games, building with LEGO, and exploring various electronic-
            related projects, including home assistants. These interests not only fuel my passion for
            technology but also enhance my creative problem-solving abilities.</p>
